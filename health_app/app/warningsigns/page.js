      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        John, a 14-year-old student, began showing signs of social withdrawal and poor academic performance. His parents initially believed it was due to the pressure of starting high school. 
        However, as John&apos;s mood swings became more frequent and he lost interest in hobbies like soccer and video games, his parents grew concerned.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        After noticing John&apos;s behavior, his parents reached out to a school counselor who suggested further evaluation. With professional support, John was diagnosed with anxiety, and his parents were able to work with therapists to provide him with the support he needed to manage his symptoms.
